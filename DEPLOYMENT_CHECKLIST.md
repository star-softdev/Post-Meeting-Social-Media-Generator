## Deployment Steps

### 1. Build Application
```bash
npm run build
npm run type-check
npm run lint
```

### 2. Run Tests
```bash
npm run test:all
```

### 3. Database Migration
```bash
npm run db:push
```

### 4. Docker Build (if using Docker)
```bash
npm run docker:build
```

### 5. Deploy to Production
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### 6. Health Check
```bash
npm run health
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### ✅ Application Health
- [ ] Application starts successfully
- [ ] Health check endpoint responds
- [ ] Database connection works
- [ ] Authentication flow works
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly

### ✅ Monitoring
- [ ] Metrics are being collected
- [ ] Logs are being generated
- [ ] Alerts are configured
- [ ] Dashboards are working

### ✅ Security
- [ ] SSL certificate is valid
- [ ] Security headers are set
- [ ] Rate limiting is working
- [ ] Authentication is secure

### ✅ Performance
- [ ] Response times are acceptable
- [ ] Database queries are optimized
- [ ] Caching is working
- [ ] Load balancing is configured

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Occur
1. **Immediate**: Check application logs
2. **Quick Fix**: Restart application services
3. **Rollback**: Deploy previous version
4. **Investigation**: Analyze logs and metrics
5. **Resolution**: Fix issues and redeploy

### Rollback Commands
```bash
# Stop current deployment
npm run docker:stop

# Deploy previous version
git checkout <previous-commit>
npm run docker:run

# Verify rollback
npm run health
```
